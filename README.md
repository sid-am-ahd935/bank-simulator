# bank-simulator
Want to know how the bank transacts? Well here we go! This project is a live demonstration built on the fundamental concepts of transactions, data recording, logging, identity verification and much more! By working on this project, I am hoping to learn about concurrency, scaling, ACID, SOLID and other concepts used in developing high end projects.
