# Bank Simulator
Want to know how the bank transacts? Well here we go! This project is a live demonstration built on the fundamental concepts of transactions, data recording, logging, identity verification and much more! By working on this project, I am hoping to learn about concurrency, scaling, ACID, SOLID and other concepts used in developing high end projects.

Please note that this is not based on an actual banking system but is derived from the various concepts they use. Actual banks have complex logic built on sophisticated code which is intended to make it more secure and reliable. I will be making this project with the intention of replicating the functions of a generic bank. 

Disclaimer: This project is not intended to harm any object, being, or organisation. I just want to make some real life applicable project which either simulates or eases worldly tasks.
